Brainfuck Programming Language Compiler

# Description
Brainfuck is ~~awesome~~ a programming language notable for extreme minimalism. I could not find a compiler for it nor I could understand that programming language. Now I have both - understanding and a compiler. :blush: 

Feel free to reuse this code. I coded it during presentaion (link below).

BTW here is "hello world" in brainfuck:
```
